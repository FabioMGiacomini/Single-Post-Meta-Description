The easiest way to add for every post a different meta description tag in html head.

== Description ==
This plugin adds a new field in every post, where you can write a text that will be inserted in the related meta tag, located in the head section.

The main options page of the plugin, provides you with a default text area, where you can insert a default description that will appear in case the field in post page is empty.

If you do not provide neither a default meta tag description nor a post meta tag  description, the post's excerpt will appear in the html meta tag.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/single-post-meta-description` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->single-post-meta-description screen to configure the plugin
